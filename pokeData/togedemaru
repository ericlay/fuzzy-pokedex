 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Iron-barbs:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user takes 1/8 of its maximum 
  HP in damage.

  This ability functions identically 
  to rough skin.

  Lightning-rod:

    All other Pokémon's single-target 
  electric-type moves are redirected 
  to this Pokémon if it is an eligible 
  target. Other Pokémon's Electric 
  moves raise this Pokémon's Special 
  Attack one stage, negating any 
  other effect on it, and cannot 
  miss it.

  If the move's intended target 
  also has this ability, the move 
  is not redirected. When multiple 
  Pokémon with this ability are 
  possible targets for redirection, 
  the move is redirected to the 
  one with the highest Speed stat, 
  or, in the case of a tie, to 
  a random tied Pokémon. follow 
  me takes precedence over this 
  ability.

  If the Pokémon is a ground-type 
  and thus immune to Electric moves, 
  its immunity prevents the Special 
  Attack boost.

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.
