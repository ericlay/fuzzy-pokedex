  Dry-skin:

    This Pokémon takes 1/8 of its 
  maximum HP in damage after each 
  turn during strong sunlight, 
  but it heals for 1/8 of its HP 
  each turn during rain. This Pokémon 
  takes 1.25× as much damage from 
  fire-type moves, but whenever 
  a water move hits it, it heals 
  for 1/4 its maximum HP instead.

  Sand-veil:

    During a sandstorm, this Pokémon 
  has 1.25× its evasion, and it 
  does not take sandstorm damage 
  regardless of type.

  The evasion bonus does not 
  count as a stat modifier.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved in a sandstorm.

  Solar-power:

    During strong sunlight, this 
  Pokémon has 1.5× its Special 
  Attack but takes 1/8 of its maximum 
  HP in damage after each turn.
