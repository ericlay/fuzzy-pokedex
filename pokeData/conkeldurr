  Guts:

    Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, 
  burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, 
  it has 1.5× its Attack. This 
  Pokémon is not affected by the 
  usual Attack cut from a burn.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.

  Sheer-force:

    This Pokémon's moves with extra 
  effects have 1.3× their power, 
  but lose their extra effects.

  An effect chance is a move's 
  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, thunder shock's paralysis 
  is an extra effect, but thunder 
  wave's is not, nor are knock 
  off's item removal and air cutter's 
  increased critical hit rate.

  Moves that lower the user's 
  stats are unaffected.

  Iron-fist:

    Moves flagged as being punch-based 
  have 1.2× their base power for 
  this Pokémon.

  sucker punch is not flagged 
  as punch-based; its original, 
  Japanese name only means "surprise 
  attack".
