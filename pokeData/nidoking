  Poison-point:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  poisoned.

  Rivalry:

    This Pokémon inflicts 1.25× 
  as much regular damage against 
  Pokémon of the same gender and 
  0.75× as much regular damage 
  against Pokémon of the opposite 
  gender.

  If either Pokémon is genderless, 
  damage is unaffected.

  Sheer-force:

    This Pokémon's moves with extra 
  effects have 1.3× their power, 
  but lose their extra effects.

  An effect chance is a move's 
  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, thunder shock's paralysis 
  is an extra effect, but thunder 
  wave's is not, nor are knock 
  off's item removal and air cutter's 
  increased critical hit rate.

  Moves that lower the user's 
  stats are unaffected.
