  Honey-gather:

    This Pokémon has a chance of 
  picking up honey after each battle. 
  This chance starts at 5% and 
  rises another 5% after every 
  tenth level: 5% from level 1–10, 
  10% from 11–20, and so on, up 
  to 50% from 91–100.

  This ability is checked after 
  the battle ends, at which point 
  any temporary ability changes 
  have worn off.

  Hustle:

    This Pokémon's physical moves 
  do 1.5× as much regular damage, 
  but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.

  Special moves are unaffected. 
  Moves that do set damage, such 
  as seismic toss, have their accuracy 
  affected, but not their damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.
