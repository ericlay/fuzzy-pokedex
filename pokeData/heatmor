 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Gluttony:

    This Pokémon eats any held 
  Berry triggered by low HP when 
  it falls below 50% of its HP, 
  regardless of the Berry's usual 
  threshold.

  Flash-fire:

    This Pokémon is immune to fire-type 
  moves. Once this Pokémon has 
  been hit by a Fire move, its 
  own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× 
  as much damage until it leaves 
  battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  while the Pokémon is frozen. 
  The Fire damage bonus is retained 
  even if the Pokémon is frozen 
  and thawed or the ability is 
  lost or disabled. Fire moves 
  will ignore this Pokémon's substitute. 
  This ability takes effect even 
  on non-damaging moves, i.e. will 
  o wisp.

  White-smoke:

    This Pokémon cannot have its 
  stats lowered by other Pokémon.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any stat losses other than stat 
  modifiers, such as the Speed 
  cut from paralysis; nor self-inflicted 
  stat drops, such as the Special 
  Attack drop from overheat; nor 
  opponent-triggered stat boosts, 
  such as the Attack boost from 
  swagger. This Pokémon can still 
  be passed negative stat modifiers 
  through guard swap, heart swap, 
  or power swap.

  This ability functions identically 
  to clear body in battle.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved.
