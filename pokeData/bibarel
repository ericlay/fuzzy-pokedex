  Simple:

    Each stage of this Pokémon's 
  stat modifiers acts as two stages. 
  These doubled stages are still 
  limited to a minimum of -6 and 
  a maximum of 6.

  This Pokémon can still accumulate 
  less than -3 or more than 3 stages 
  of stat modifiers, even though 
  the extra ones have no effect 
  after doubling.

  Unaware:

    This Pokémon ignores other 
  Pokémon's stat modifiers for 
  the purposes of damage and accuracy 
  calculation.

  Effectively, this affects modifiers 
  of every stat except Speed.

  The power of punishment and 
  stored power is calculated as 
  usual. When this Pokémon hurts 
  itself in confusion, its stat 
  modifiers affect damage as usual.

  Moody:

    After each turn, one of this 
  Pokémon's stats at random rises 
  two stages, and another falls 
  one stage.

  If a stat is already at 6 or 
  -6 stages, it will not be chosen 
  to be increased or decreased, 
  respectively.
