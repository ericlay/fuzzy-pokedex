 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Motor-drive:

    Whenever an electric-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, its Speed 
  rises one stage, negating any 
  other effect on it.

  This ability will not take 
  effect if this Pokémon is immune 
  to Electric moves. Electric moves 
  will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.

  This effect includes non-damaging 
  moves, i.e. thunder wave.

  Vital-spirit:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to insomnia in battle.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.
