  Illuminate:

    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is doubled.

  This ability has no effect 
  in battle.

  Effect-spore:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed, poisoned, or put to 
  sleep, chosen at random.

  Nothing is done to compensate 
  if the move's user is immune 
  to one of these ailments; there 
  is simply a lower chance that 
  the move's user will be affected.

  Rain-dish:

    This Pokémon heals for 1/16 
  of its maximum HP after each 
  turn during rain.
