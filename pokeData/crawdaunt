 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Hyper-cutter:

    This Pokémon's Attack cannot 
  be lowered by other Pokémon.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any Attack losses other than 
  stat modifiers, such as the Attack 
  cut from a burn. This Pokémon 
  can still be passed negative 
  Attack modifiers through heart 
  swap or power swap.

  Shell-armor:

    Moves cannot score critical 
  hits against this Pokémon.

  This ability functions identically 
  to battle armor.

  Adaptability:

    This Pokémon inflicts twice 
  as much damage with moves whose 
  types match its own, rather than 
  the usual same-type attack bonus 
  of 1.5×.


 Location Areas:
   Celestic town area
   Striaton city area
   Unova route 3 area
