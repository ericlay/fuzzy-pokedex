 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Rock-head:

    This Pokémon does not receive 
  recoil damage from its recoil 
  moves.

  struggle's recoil is unaffected. 
  This ability does not prevent 
  crash damage from missing with 
  jump kick or high jump kick.

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.

  Weak-armor:

    Whenever a physical move hits 
  this Pokémon, its Speed rises 
  one stage and its Defense falls 
  one stage.

  This ability triggers on every 
  hit of a multiple-hit move.
