 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Rock-head:

    This Pokémon does not receive 
  recoil damage from its recoil 
  moves.

  struggle's recoil is unaffected. 
  This ability does not prevent 
  crash damage from missing with 
  jump kick or high jump kick.

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.

  Sand-veil:

    During a sandstorm, this Pokémon 
  has 1.25× its evasion, and it 
  does not take sandstorm damage 
  regardless of type.

  The evasion bonus does not 
  count as a stat modifier.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved in a sandstorm.
