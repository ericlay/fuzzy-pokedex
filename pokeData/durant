 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Swarm:

    When this Pokémon has 1/3 or 
  less of its HP remaining, its 
  bug-type moves inflict 1.5× as 
  much regular damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is increased.

  Hustle:

    This Pokémon's physical moves 
  do 1.5× as much regular damage, 
  but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.

  Special moves are unaffected. 
  Moves that do set damage, such 
  as seismic toss, have their accuracy 
  affected, but not their damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.

  Truant:

    Every second turn on which 
  this Pokémon should attempt to 
  use a move, it will instead do 
  nothing ("loaf around").

  Loafing around interrupts moves 
  that take multiple turns the 
  same way paralysis, flinching, 
  etc do. Most such moves, for 
  example bide or rollout, are 
  simply cut off upon loafing around. 
  Attacks with a recharge turn, 
  such as hyper beam, do not have 
  to recharge; attacks with a preparation 
  turn, such as fly, do not end 
  up being used. Moves that are 
  forced over multiple turns and 
  keep going through failure, such 
  as outrage, uproar, or any move 
  forced by encore, keep going 
  as usual.

  If this Pokémon is confused, 
  its confusion is not checked 
  when loafing around; the Pokémon 
  cannot hurt itself, and its confusion 
  does not end or come closer to 
  ending.

  If this Pokémon attempts to 
  move but fails, e.g. because 
  of paralysis or gravity, it still 
  counts as having moved and will 
  loaf around the next turn. If 
  it does not attempt to move, 
  e.g. because it is asleep or 
  frozen, whatever it would have 
  done will be postponed until 
  its next attempt; that is, it 
  will either loaf around or move 
  as usual, depending on what it 
  last did.

  This ability cannot be changed 
  with worry seed, but it can be 
  disabled with gastro acid, changed 
  with role play, or traded away 
  with skill swap.
