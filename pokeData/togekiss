  Hustle:

    This Pokémon's physical moves 
  do 1.5× as much regular damage, 
  but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.

  Special moves are unaffected. 
  Moves that do set damage, such 
  as seismic toss, have their accuracy 
  affected, but not their damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.

  Serene-grace:

    This Pokémon's moves have twice 
  their usual effect chance.

  An effect chance is a move's 
  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, flamethrower's chance 
  of burning the target is doubled, 
  but protect's chance of success 
  and air cutter's increased critical 
  hit rate are unaffected.

  secret power is unaffected.

  Super-luck:

    This Pokémon's moves have critical 
  hit rates one stage higher than 
  normal.
