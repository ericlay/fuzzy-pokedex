 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Intimidate:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  the opponent's Attack is lowered 
  by one stage. In a double battle, 
  both opponents are affected.

  This ability also takes effect 
  when acquired during a battle, 
  but will not take effect again 
  if lost and reobtained without 
  leaving battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  on an opponent that has a substitute.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.

  Anger-point:

    Whenever this Pokémon receives 
  a critical hit, its Attack rises 
  to the maximum of 6 stages.

  This ability will still take 
  effect if the critical hit is 
  received by a substitute.

  Sheer-force:

    This Pokémon's moves with extra 
  effects have 1.3× their power, 
  but lose their extra effects.

  An effect chance is a move's 
  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, thunder shock's paralysis 
  is an extra effect, but thunder 
  wave's is not, nor are knock 
  off's item removal and air cutter's 
  increased critical hit rate.

  Moves that lower the user's 
  stats are unaffected.
