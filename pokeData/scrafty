 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Shed-skin:

    After each turn, this Pokémon 
  has a 33% of being cured of any 
  major status ailment.

  Moxie:

    This Pokémon's Attack rises 
  one stage upon knocking out another 
  Pokémon, even a friendly Pokémon.

  This ability does not take 
  effect when the Pokémon indirectly 
  causes another Pokémon to faint, 
  e.g. through poison or spikes.

  If this Pokémon knocks out 
  a Pokémon with mummy, the former's 
  ability will change without taking 
  effect.

  Intimidate:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  the opponent's Attack is lowered 
  by one stage. In a double battle, 
  both opponents are affected.

  This ability also takes effect 
  when acquired during a battle, 
  but will not take effect again 
  if lost and reobtained without 
  leaving battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  on an opponent that has a substitute.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.
