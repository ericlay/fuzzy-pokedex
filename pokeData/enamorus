  Cute-charm:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  infatuated.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any wild Pokémon whose species 
  can be either gender has a 2/3 
  chance of being set to the opposite 
  gender, and a 1/3 chance of having 
  a random gender as usual.

  Contrary:

    Whenever this Pokémon's stats 
  would be raised, they are instead 
  lowered by the same amount, and 
  vice versa.
