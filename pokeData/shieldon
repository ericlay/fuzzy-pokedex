  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.

  Soundproof:

    This Pokémon is immune to moves 
  flagged as being sound-based.

  heal bell is unaffected. uproar 
  still prevents this Pokémon from 
  sleeping. This Pokémon can still 
  receive a Perish Song counter 
  through baton pass, and will 
  retain a Perish Song counter 
  if it acquires this ability after 
  Perish Song is used.

  howl, roar of time, sonic boom, 
  and yawn are not flagged as sound-based.
