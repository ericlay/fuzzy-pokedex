 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Magnet-pull:

    While this Pokémon is in battle, 
  opposing steel-type Pokémon cannot 
  flee or switch out.

  Pokémon with run away can still 
  flee. Pokémon can still switch 
  out with the use of a move or 
  item.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, Steel-type 
  Pokémon have a higher encounter 
  rate.

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.

  Analytic:

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.3× 
  their power when it moves last 
  in a turn.

  future sight and doom desire 
  are unaffected.
