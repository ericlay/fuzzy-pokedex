  Minun    Electric Type Pokémon

  MINUN is more concerned about 
  cheering on its partners than 
  its own safety.  It shorts out 
  the electricity in its body to 
  create brilliant showers of sparks 
  to cheer on its teammates. 
  Single Stage Evolution Pokémon

 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Minus:

    This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special 
  Attack if any friendly Pokémon 
  has plus or minus.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier. If either ability 
  is disabled by gastro acid, both 
  lose their effect.

  Volt-absorb:

    Whenever an electric-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, it heals for 
  1/4 of its maximum HP, negating 
  any other effect on it.

  This ability will not take 
  effect if this Pokémon is ground-type 
  and thus immune to Electric moves. 
  Electric moves will ignore this 
  Pokémon's substitute.

  This effect includes non-damaging 
  moves, i.e. thunder wave.
