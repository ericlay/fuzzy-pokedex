  Stench:

    This Pokémon's damaging moves 
  have a 10% chance to make the 
  target flinch with each hit if 
  they do not already cause flinching 
  as a secondary effect.

  This ability does not stack 
  with a held item.

  Overworld: The wild encounter 
  rate is halved while this Pokémon 
  is first in the party.

  Sticky-hold:

    This Pokémon's hold item cannot 
  be removed by other Pokémon.

  Damaging moves that would remove 
  this Pokémon's item can still 
  inflict damage against this Pokémon, 
  e.g. knock off or pluck. This 
  Pokémon can still use moves that 
  involve the loss of its own item, 
  e.g. fling or trick.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the encounter 
  rate while fishing is increased.

  Aftermath:

    When this Pokémon is knocked 
  out by a move that makes contact, 
  the move's user takes 1/4 its 
  maximum HP in damage.
