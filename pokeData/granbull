 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Intimidate:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  the opponent's Attack is lowered 
  by one stage. In a double battle, 
  both opponents are affected.

  This ability also takes effect 
  when acquired during a battle, 
  but will not take effect again 
  if lost and reobtained without 
  leaving battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  on an opponent that has a substitute.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.

  Quick-feet:

    Whenever this Pokémon has a 
  major status ailment, it has 
  1.5× its Speed. This Pokémon 
  is not affected by the usual 
  Speed cut from paralysis.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved.

  Rattled:

    This Pokémon's Speed rises 
  one stage with each hit from 
  a damaging dark-, ghost-, or 
  bug-type move.
