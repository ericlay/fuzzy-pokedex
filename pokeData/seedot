  Seedot    Grass Type Pokémon

  SEEDOT attaches itself to a 
  tree branch using the top of 
  its head.  It sucks moisture 
  from the tree while hanging off 
  the branch.  The more water it 
  drinks, the glossier Seedot’s 
  body becomes.

  Chlorophyll:

    This Pokémon's Speed is doubled 
  during strong sunlight.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.

  Early-bird:

    This Pokémon's remaining sleep 
  turn count falls by 2 rather 
  than 1.

  If this Pokémon's sleep counter 
  is at 1, it will fall to 0 and 
  then the Pokémon will wake up.

  Pickpocket:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, if it does 
  not have a held item, it steals 
  the attacker's held item.

  This Pokémon cannot steal upon 
  being knocked out. It can steal 
  if the attacker has a substitute, 
  but cannot steal when its own 
  Substitute is hit. If a move 
  hits multiple times, only the 
  last hit triggers this ability. 
  If this Pokémon is wild, it cannot 
  steal from a trained Pokémon.
