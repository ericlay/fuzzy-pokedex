 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Magma-armor:

    This Pokémon cannot be frozen.

  If a Pokémon is frozen and 
  acquires this ability, it will 
  immediately thaw out; this includes 
  when regaining a lost ability 
  upon leaving battle.

  Overworld: If any Pokémon in 
  the party has this ability, each 
  egg in the party has its hatch 
  counter decreased by 2 (rather 
  than 1) each step cycle, making 
  eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly. 
  This effect does not stack if 
  multiple Pokémon have this ability 
  or flame body.

  Solid-rock:

    This Pokémon takes 0.75× as 
  much damage from moves that are 
  super effective against it.

  This ability functions identically 
  to filter.

  Anger-point:

    Whenever this Pokémon receives 
  a critical hit, its Attack rises 
  to the maximum of 6 stages.

  This ability will still take 
  effect if the critical hit is 
  received by a substitute.
