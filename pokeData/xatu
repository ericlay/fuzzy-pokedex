 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Synchronize:

    Whenever this Pokémon is burned, 
  paralyzed, or poisoned, the Pokémon 
  who gave this Pokémon that ailment 
  is also given the ailment.

  This ability passes back bad 
  poison when this Pokémon is badly 
  poisoned. This ability cannot 
  pass on a status ailment that 
  the Pokémon did not directly 
  receive from another Pokémon, 
  such as the poison from toxic 
  spikes or the burn from a flame 
  orb.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, wild Pokémon 
  have a 50% chance of having the 
  lead Pokémon's nature, and a 
  50% chance of being given a random 
  nature as usual, including the 
  lead Pokémon's nature. This does 
  not work on Pokémon received 
  outside of battle or roaming 
  legendaries.

  Early-bird:

    This Pokémon's remaining sleep 
  turn count falls by 2 rather 
  than 1.

  If this Pokémon's sleep counter 
  is at 1, it will fall to 0 and 
  then the Pokémon will wake up.

  Magic-bounce:

    When this Pokémon is targeted 
  by a move flagged as being reflectable, 
  the move is redirected to its 
  user.

  All reflectable moves are non-damaging, 
  and most non-damaging moves that 
  target other Pokémon are reflectable.

  A move reflected by this ability 
  or magic coat cannot be reflected 
  back.
