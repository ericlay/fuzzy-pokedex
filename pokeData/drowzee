 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Insomnia:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to vital spirit in battle.

  Forewarn:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  it reveals the move with the 
  highest base power known by any 
  opposing Pokémon to all participating 
  trainers.

  In the event of a tie, one 
  is chosen at random.

  Moves without a listed base 
  power are assigned one as follows:

  Power | Moves
----: | -----
 160 | One-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold
 120 | Counter moves: counter, 
  metal burst, and mirror coat
  80 | Variable power or set 
  damage: crush grip, dragon rage, 
  electro ball, endeavor, final 
  gambit, flail, frustration, grass 
  knot, gyro ball, heat crash,

  kick, natural gift, night shade, 
  psywave, return, reversal, seismic
