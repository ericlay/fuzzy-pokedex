 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Sticky-hold:

    This Pokémon's hold item cannot 
  be removed by other Pokémon.

  Damaging moves that would remove 
  this Pokémon's item can still 
  inflict damage against this Pokémon, 
  e.g. knock off or pluck. This 
  Pokémon can still use moves that 
  involve the loss of its own item, 
  e.g. fling or trick.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the encounter 
  rate while fishing is increased.

  Storm-drain:

    All other Pokémon's single-target 
  water-type moves are redirected 
  to this Pokémon, if it is an 
  eligible target. Other Pokémon's 
  Water moves raise this Pokémon's 
  Special Attack one stage, negating 
  any other effect on it, and cannot 
  miss it.

  If the move's intended target 
  also has this ability, the move 
  is not redirected. When multiple 
  Pokémon with this ability are 
  possible targets for redirection, 
  the move is redirected to the 
  one with the highest Speed stat, 
  or, in the case of a tie, to 
  a random tied Pokémon. follow 
  me takes precedence over this 
  ability.

  Sand-force:

    During a sandstorm, this Pokémon's 
  rock-, ground-, and steel-type 
  moves have 1.3× their base power. 
  This Pokémon does not take sandstorm 
  damage, regardless of type.
