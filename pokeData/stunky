  Stench:

    This Pokémon's damaging moves 
  have a 10% chance to make the 
  target flinch with each hit if 
  they do not already cause flinching 
  as a secondary effect.

  This ability does not stack 
  with a held item.

  Overworld: The wild encounter 
  rate is halved while this Pokémon 
  is first in the party.

  Aftermath:

    When this Pokémon is knocked 
  out by a move that makes contact, 
  the move's user takes 1/4 its 
  maximum HP in damage.

  Keen-eye:

    This Pokémon cannot have its 
  accuracy lowered.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any accuracy losses other than 
  stat modifiers, such as the accuracy 
  cut from fog; nor does it prevent 
  other Pokémon's evasion from 
  making this Pokémon's moves less 
  accurate. This Pokémon can still 
  be passed negative accuracy modifiers 
  through heart swap.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.
