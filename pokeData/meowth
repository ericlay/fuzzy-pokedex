  Pickup:

    At the end of each turn, if 
  another Pokémon consumed or Flung 
  a held item that turn, this Pokémon 
  picks up the item if it is not 
  already holding one. After each 
  battle, this Pokémon has a 10% 
  chance of picking up an item 
  if it is not already holding 
  one.

  The air balloon and eject button 
  cannot be picked up.

  The items that may be found 
  vary by game, and, since Pokémon 
  Emerald, by the Pokémon's level. 
  This ability is checked after 
  the battle ends, at which point 
  any temporary ability changes 
  have worn off.

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× 
  their power if their base power 
  is 60 or less.

  This includes moves of variable 
  power, such as hidden power and 
  magnitude, when their power is 
  60 or less. helping hand's power 
  boost is taken into account for 
  any move, as is defense curl's 
  power boost for rollout.

  Unnerve:

    Opposing Pokémon cannot eat 
  held Berries while this Pokémon 
  is in battle.

  Affected Pokémon can still 
  use bug bite or pluck to eat 
  a target's Berry.
