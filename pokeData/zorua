  Illusion:

    This Pokémon, upon being sent 
  out, appears to have the species, 
  nickname, and Poké Ball of the 
  last Pokémon in the party that 
  is able to battle. This illusion 
  breaks upon being hit by a damaging 
  move.

  Other damage, e.g. from weather 
  or spikes, does not break the 
  illusion, nor does damage done 
  to a substitute.

  If the party order becomes 
  temporarily shuffled around as 
  Pokémon are switched out in battle, 
  this ability chooses the last 
  Pokémon according to that shuffled 
  order.
