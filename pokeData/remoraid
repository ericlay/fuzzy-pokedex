 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Hustle:

    This Pokémon's physical moves 
  do 1.5× as much regular damage, 
  but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.

  Special moves are unaffected. 
  Moves that do set damage, such 
  as seismic toss, have their accuracy 
  affected, but not their damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.

  Sniper:

    This Pokémon inflicts triple 
  damage with critical hits, rather 
  than the usual double damage.

  Moody:

    After each turn, one of this 
  Pokémon's stats at random rises 
  two stages, and another falls 
  one stage.

  If a stat is already at 6 or 
  -6 stages, it will not be chosen 
  to be increased or decreased, 
  respectively.
