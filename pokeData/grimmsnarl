 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Prankster:

    This Pokémon's non-damaging 
  moves have their priority increased 
  by one stage.

  Frisk:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  it reveals an opposing Pokémon's 
  held item to all participating 
  trainers.

  In a double battle, if one 
  opponent has an item, this Pokémon 
  will Frisk that Pokémon; if both 
  have an item, it will Frisk one 
  at random.

  Pickpocket:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, if it does 
  not have a held item, it steals 
  the attacker's held item.

  This Pokémon cannot steal upon 
  being knocked out. It can steal 
  if the attacker has a substitute, 
  but cannot steal when its own 
  Substitute is hit. If a move 
  hits multiple times, only the 
  last hit triggers this ability. 
  If this Pokémon is wild, it cannot 
  steal from a trained Pokémon.
