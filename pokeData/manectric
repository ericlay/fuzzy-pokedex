 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Static:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed.

  Pokémon that are immune to 
  electric-type moves can still 
  be paralyzed by this ability.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, there is a 
  50% chance that encounters will 
  be with an electric Pokémon, 
  if applicable.

  Lightning-rod:

    All other Pokémon's single-target 
  electric-type moves are redirected 
  to this Pokémon if it is an eligible 
  target. Other Pokémon's Electric 
  moves raise this Pokémon's Special 
  Attack one stage, negating any 
  other effect on it, and cannot 
  miss it.

  If the move's intended target 
  also has this ability, the move 
  is not redirected. When multiple 
  Pokémon with this ability are 
  possible targets for redirection, 
  the move is redirected to the 
  one with the highest Speed stat, 
  or, in the case of a tie, to 
  a random tied Pokémon. follow 
  me takes precedence over this 
  ability.

  If the Pokémon is a ground-type 
  and thus immune to Electric moves, 
  its immunity prevents the Special 
  Attack boost.

  Minus:

    This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special 
  Attack if any friendly Pokémon 
  has plus or minus.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier. If either ability 
  is disabled by gastro acid, both 
  lose their effect.
