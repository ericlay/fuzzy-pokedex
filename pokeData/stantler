 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Intimidate:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  the opponent's Attack is lowered 
  by one stage. In a double battle, 
  both opponents are affected.

  This ability also takes effect 
  when acquired during a battle, 
  but will not take effect again 
  if lost and reobtained without 
  leaving battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  on an opponent that has a substitute.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.

  Frisk:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  it reveals an opposing Pokémon's 
  held item to all participating 
  trainers.

  In a double battle, if one 
  opponent has an item, this Pokémon 
  will Frisk that Pokémon; if both 
  have an item, it will Frisk one 
  at random.

  Sap-sipper:

    Whenever a grass-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, its Attack 
  rises one stage, negating any 
  other effect on it.
