 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Hyper-cutter:

    This Pokémon's Attack cannot 
  be lowered by other Pokémon.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any Attack losses other than 
  stat modifiers, such as the Attack 
  cut from a burn. This Pokémon 
  can still be passed negative 
  Attack modifiers through heart 
  swap or power swap.

  Sand-veil:

    During a sandstorm, this Pokémon 
  has 1.25× its evasion, and it 
  does not take sandstorm damage 
  regardless of type.

  The evasion bonus does not 
  count as a stat modifier.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved in a sandstorm.

  Poison-heal:

    If this Pokémon is poisoned, 
  it will heal for 1/8 of its maximum 
  HP after each turn rather than 
  taking damage. This includes 
  bad poison.
