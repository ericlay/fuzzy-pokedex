  Anticipation:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  if one of its opponents has a 
  move that is super effective 
  against it, self destruct, explosion, 
  or a one-hit knockout move, all 
  participating trainers are notified.

  The move itself is not revealed; 
  only that there is such a move. 
  Moves that inflict typeless damage, 
  such as future sight, and moves 
  of variable type, such as hidden 
  power, count as their listed 
  types. counter, metal burst, 
  mirror coat, and one-hit KO moves 
  to which this Pokémon is immune 
  do not trigger this ability.

  Dry-skin:

    This Pokémon takes 1/8 of its 
  maximum HP in damage after each 
  turn during strong sunlight, 
  but it heals for 1/8 of its HP 
  each turn during rain. This Pokémon 
  takes 1.25× as much damage from 
  fire-type moves, but whenever 
  a water move hits it, it heals 
  for 1/4 its maximum HP instead.

  Poison-touch:

    This Pokémon's contact moves 
  have a 30% chance of poisoning 
  the target with each hit.

  This counts as an extra effect 
  for the purposes of shield dust. 
  This ability takes effect before 
  mummy.
