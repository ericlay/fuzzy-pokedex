 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Telepathy:

    This Pokémon does not take 
  damage from friendly Pokémon's 
  moves, including single-target 
  moves aimed at it.

  Synchronize:

    Whenever this Pokémon is burned, 
  paralyzed, or poisoned, the Pokémon 
  who gave this Pokémon that ailment 
  is also given the ailment.

  This ability passes back bad 
  poison when this Pokémon is badly 
  poisoned. This ability cannot 
  pass on a status ailment that 
  the Pokémon did not directly 
  receive from another Pokémon, 
  such as the poison from toxic 
  spikes or the burn from a flame 
  orb.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, wild Pokémon 
  have a 50% chance of having the 
  lead Pokémon's nature, and a 
  50% chance of being given a random 
  nature as usual, including the 
  lead Pokémon's nature. This does 
  not work on Pokémon received 
  outside of battle or roaming 
  legendaries.

  Analytic:

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.3× 
  their power when it moves last 
  in a turn.

  future sight and doom desire 
  are unaffected.
