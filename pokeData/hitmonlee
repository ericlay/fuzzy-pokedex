  Limber:

    This Pokémon cannot be paralyzed.

  If a Pokémon is paralyzed and 
  acquires this ability, its paralysis 
  is healed; this includes when 
  regaining a lost ability upon 
  leaving battle.

  Reckless:

    This Pokémon's recoil moves 
  and crash moves have 1.2× their 
  base power.

  struggle is unaffected.

  The "crash moves" are the moves 
  that damage the user upon missing: 
  jump kick and high jump kick.

  Unburden:

    When this Pokémon uses or loses 
  its held item, its Speed is doubled. 
  If it gains another item or leaves 
  battle, this bonus is lost.

  This includes when the Pokémon 
  drops its item because of knock 
  off. This bonus does not count 
  as a stat modifier. There is 
  no notification when this ability 
  takes effect.
