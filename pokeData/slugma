  Magma-armor:

    This Pokémon cannot be frozen.

  If a Pokémon is frozen and 
  acquires this ability, it will 
  immediately thaw out; this includes 
  when regaining a lost ability 
  upon leaving battle.

  Overworld: If any Pokémon in 
  the party has this ability, each 
  egg in the party has its hatch 
  counter decreased by 2 (rather 
  than 1) each step cycle, making 
  eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly. 
  This effect does not stack if 
  multiple Pokémon have this ability 
  or flame body.

  Flame-body:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  burned.

  Overworld: If any Pokémon in 
  the party has this ability, each 
  egg in the party has its hatch 
  counter decreased by 2 (rather 
  than 1) each step cycle, making 
  eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly. 
  This effect does not stack if 
  multiple Pokémon have this ability 
  or magma armor.

  Weak-armor:

    Whenever a physical move hits 
  this Pokémon, its Speed rises 
  one stage and its Defense falls 
  one stage.

  This ability triggers on every 
  hit of a multiple-hit move.
