 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Volt-absorb:

    Whenever an electric-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, it heals for 
  1/4 of its maximum HP, negating 
  any other effect on it.

  This ability will not take 
  effect if this Pokémon is ground-type 
  and thus immune to Electric moves. 
  Electric moves will ignore this 
  Pokémon's substitute.

  This effect includes non-damaging 
  moves, i.e. thunder wave.

  Illuminate:

    Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is doubled.

  This ability has no effect 
  in battle.

  Water-absorb:

    Whenever a water-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, it heals for 
  1/4 of its maximum HP, negating 
  any other effect on it.

  Water moves will ignore this 
  Pokémon's substitute.
