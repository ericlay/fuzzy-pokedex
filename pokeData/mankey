 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Vital-spirit:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to insomnia in battle.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.

  Anger-point:

    Whenever this Pokémon receives 
  a critical hit, its Attack rises 
  to the maximum of 6 stages.

  This ability will still take 
  effect if the critical hit is 
  received by a substitute.

  Defiant:

    When any of this Pokémon's 
  stats are lowered, its Attack 
  rises by two stages.

  If multiple stats are lowered 
  at once, this ability takes effect 
  with each stat lowered.
