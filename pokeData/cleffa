  Cute-charm:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  infatuated.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any wild Pokémon whose species 
  can be either gender has a 2/3 
  chance of being set to the opposite 
  gender, and a 1/3 chance of having 
  a random gender as usual.

  Magic-guard:

    This Pokémon is immune to damage 
  not directly caused by a move.

  For example, this Pokémon takes 
  no damage from from weather, 
  recoil, status ailments, or spikes, 
  but it still suffers from the 
  Attack cut when burned, and a 
  life orb will still power up 
  this Pokémon's moves without 
  damaging it. Anything that directly 
  depends on such damage will also 
  not happen; for example, leech 
  seed will neither hurt this Pokémon 
  nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon 
  with a jaboca berry or rowap 
  berry will not consume the berry 
  when hit by this Pokémon.

  The following are unaffected: 
  struggle, pain split (whether 
  used by or against this Pokémon), 
  belly drum, substitute, curse, 
  moves that knock the user out, 
  and damage from confusion.

  This Pokémon will neither lose 
  nor regain HP if it drains HP 
  from a Pokémon with liquid ooze.

  If this Pokémon is badly poisoned, 
  the poison counter is still increased 
  each turn; if the Pokémon loses 
  this ability, it will begin taking 
  as much damage as it would be 
  if it had been taking increasing 
  damage each turn.

  Friend-guard:

    All friendly Pokémon take 0.75× 
  as much direct damage from moves 
  while this Pokémon is in battle.

  This effect stacks if multiple 
  allied Pokémon have it.
