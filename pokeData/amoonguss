  Effect-spore:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed, poisoned, or put to 
  sleep, chosen at random.

  Nothing is done to compensate 
  if the move's user is immune 
  to one of these ailments; there 
  is simply a lower chance that 
  the move's user will be affected.

  Regenerator:

    This Pokémon regains 1/3 of 
  its maximum HP when it is switched 
  out for another Pokémon under 
  any circumstances other than 
  having fainted.

  This ability does not take 
  effect when a battle ends.
