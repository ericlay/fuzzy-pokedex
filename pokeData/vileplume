  Chlorophyll:

    This Pokémon's Speed is doubled 
  during strong sunlight.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.

  Effect-spore:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed, poisoned, or put to 
  sleep, chosen at random.

  Nothing is done to compensate 
  if the move's user is immune 
  to one of these ailments; there 
  is simply a lower chance that 
  the move's user will be affected.
