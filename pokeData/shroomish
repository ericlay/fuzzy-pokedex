 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Effect-spore:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed, poisoned, or put to 
  sleep, chosen at random.

  Nothing is done to compensate 
  if the move's user is immune 
  to one of these ailments; there 
  is simply a lower chance that 
  the move's user will be affected.

  Poison-heal:

    If this Pokémon is poisoned, 
  it will heal for 1/8 of its maximum 
  HP after each turn rather than 
  taking damage. This includes 
  bad poison.

  Quick-feet:

    Whenever this Pokémon has a 
  major status ailment, it has 
  1.5× its Speed. This Pokémon 
  is not affected by the usual 
  Speed cut from paralysis.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved.
