 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Vital-spirit:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to insomnia in battle.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.

  Pickup:

    At the end of each turn, if 
  another Pokémon consumed or Flung 
  a held item that turn, this Pokémon 
  picks up the item if it is not 
  already holding one. After each 
  battle, this Pokémon has a 10% 
  chance of picking up an item 
  if it is not already holding 
  one.

  The air balloon and eject button 
  cannot be picked up.

  The items that may be found 
  vary by game, and, since Pokémon 
  Emerald, by the Pokémon's level. 
  This ability is checked after 
  the battle ends, at which point 
  any temporary ability changes 
  have worn off.

  Run-away:

    This Pokémon is always successful 
  fleeing from wild battles, even 
  if trapped by a move or ability.
