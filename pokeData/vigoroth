  Vigoroth    Normal Type Pokémon

  VIGOROTH is always itching and 
  agitated to go on a wild rampage.

 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Vital-spirit:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to insomnia in battle.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.


 Location Areas:
   Pinwheel forest inside
