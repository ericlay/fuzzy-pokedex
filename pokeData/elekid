 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Static:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed.

  Pokémon that are immune to 
  electric-type moves can still 
  be paralyzed by this ability.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, there is a 
  50% chance that encounters will 
  be with an electric Pokémon, 
  if applicable.

  Vital-spirit:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to insomnia in battle.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.
