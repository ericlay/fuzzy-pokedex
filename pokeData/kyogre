  and does not end unless replaced 
  by another weather condition.

  If multiple Pokémon with this 
  ability, drought, sand stream, 
  or snow warning are sent out 
  at the same time, the abilities 
  will activate in order of Speed, 
  respecting trick room. Each ability's 
  weather will cancel the previous 
  weather, and only the weather
