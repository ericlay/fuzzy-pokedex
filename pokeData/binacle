 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Tough-claws:

    Strengthens moves that make 
  contact to 1.33× their power.

  Sniper:

    This Pokémon inflicts triple 
  damage with critical hits, rather 
  than the usual double damage.

  Pickpocket:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, if it does 
  not have a held item, it steals 
  the attacker's held item.

  This Pokémon cannot steal upon 
  being knocked out. It can steal 
  if the attacker has a substitute, 
  but cannot steal when its own 
  Substitute is hit. If a move 
  hits multiple times, only the 
  last hit triggers this ability. 
  If this Pokémon is wild, it cannot 
  steal from a trained Pokémon.
