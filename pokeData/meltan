  Magnet-pull:

    While this Pokémon is in battle, 
  opposing steel-type Pokémon cannot 
  flee or switch out.

  Pokémon with run away can still 
  flee. Pokémon can still switch 
  out with the use of a move or 
  item.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, Steel-type 
  Pokémon have a higher encounter 
  rate.
