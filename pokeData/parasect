  Effect-spore:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed, poisoned, or put to 
  sleep, chosen at random.

  Nothing is done to compensate 
  if the move's user is immune 
  to one of these ailments; there 
  is simply a lower chance that 
  the move's user will be affected.

  Dry-skin:

    This Pokémon takes 1/8 of its 
  maximum HP in damage after each 
  turn during strong sunlight, 
  but it heals for 1/8 of its HP 
  each turn during rain. This Pokémon 
  takes 1.25× as much damage from 
  fire-type moves, but whenever 
  a water move hits it, it heals 
  for 1/4 its maximum HP instead.

  Damp:

    While this Pokémon is in battle, 
  self destruct and explosion will 
  fail and aftermath will not take 
  effect.
