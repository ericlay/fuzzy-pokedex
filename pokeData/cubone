 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Rock-head:

    This Pokémon does not receive 
  recoil damage from its recoil 
  moves.

  struggle's recoil is unaffected. 
  This ability does not prevent 
  crash damage from missing with 
  jump kick or high jump kick.

  Lightning-rod:

    All other Pokémon's single-target 
  electric-type moves are redirected 
  to this Pokémon if it is an eligible 
  target. Other Pokémon's Electric 
  moves raise this Pokémon's Special 
  Attack one stage, negating any 
  other effect on it, and cannot 
  miss it.

  If the move's intended target 
  also has this ability, the move 
  is not redirected. When multiple 
  Pokémon with this ability are 
  possible targets for redirection, 
  the move is redirected to the 
  one with the highest Speed stat, 
  or, in the case of a tie, to 
  a random tied Pokémon. follow 
  me takes precedence over this 
  ability.

  If the Pokémon is a ground-type 
  and thus immune to Electric moves, 
  its immunity prevents the Special 
  Attack boost.

  Battle-armor:

    Moves cannot score critical 
  hits against this Pokémon.

  This ability functions identically 
  to shell armor.
