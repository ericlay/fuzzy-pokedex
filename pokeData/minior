  Shields-down:

    When this Pokémon enters battle 
  and at the end of each turn, 
  if its HP is 50% or above, it 
  changes into Meteor Form; otherwise, 
  it changes into Core Form. In 
  Meteor Form, it cannot be given 
  a major status ailment (though 
  existing ones are not cured), 
  cannot become drowsy from yawn, 
  and cannot use rest (which will 
  simply fail).

  This ability cannot be copied, 
  replaced, or nullified. This 
  ability only takes effect for 
  Minior.
