  Ursaluna    Ground Type Pokémon

  I believe it was Hisui's swampy 
  terrain that gave Ursaluna its 
  burly physique and newfound capacity 
  to manipulate peat at will.

  Guts:

    Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, 
  burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, 
  it has 1.5× its Attack. This 
  Pokémon is not affected by the 
  usual Attack cut from a burn.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.

  Bulletproof:

    Protects against bullet, ball, 
  and bomb-based moves.

  Unnerve:

    Opposing Pokémon cannot eat 
  held Berries while this Pokémon 
  is in battle.

  Affected Pokémon can still 
  use bug bite or pluck to eat 
  a target's Berry.
