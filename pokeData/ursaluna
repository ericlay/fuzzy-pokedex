  Ursaluna    Ground Type Pokémon

  I believe it was Hisui's swampy 
  terrain that gave Ursaluna its 
  burly physique and newfound capacity 
  to manipulate peat at will.

    Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, 
  burned, paralyzed, or poisoned,

  a stat modifier.

    Protects against bullet, ball, 
  and bomb-based moves.

    Opposing Pokémon cannot eat 
  held Berries while this Pokémon
