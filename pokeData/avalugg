  Own-tempo:

    This Pokémon cannot be confused.

  If a Pokémon is confused and 
  acquires this ability, its confusion 
  will immediately be healed.

  Ice-body:

    This Pokémon heals for 1/16 
  of its maximum HP after each 
  turn during hail, and it does 
  not take hail damage regardless 
  of type.

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.
