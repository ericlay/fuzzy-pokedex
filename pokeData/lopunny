  Cute-charm:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  infatuated.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any wild Pokémon whose species 
  can be either gender has a 2/3 
  chance of being set to the opposite 
  gender, and a 1/3 chance of having 
  a random gender as usual.

  Klutz:

    In battle, this Pokémon cannot 
  use its held item, nor will the 
  item have any passive effect 
  on the battle, positive or negative. 
  This Pokémon also cannot use 
  fling.

  The Speed cut from the iron 
  ball and the effort items (the 
  macho brace, power weight, power 
  bracer, power belt, power lens, 
  power band, and power anklet) 
  is unaffected. Items that do 
  not directly affect the battle, 
  such as the exp share, the amulet 
  coin, or the soothe bell, work 
  as usual. All held items work 
  as usual out of battle.

  Other moves that use the held 
  item, such as natural gift and 
  switcheroo, work as usual.

  Limber:

    This Pokémon cannot be paralyzed.

  If a Pokémon is paralyzed and 
  acquires this ability, its paralysis 
  is healed; this includes when 
  regaining a lost ability upon 
  leaving battle.
