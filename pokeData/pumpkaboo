  Pickup:

    At the end of each turn, if 
  another Pokémon consumed or Flung 
  a held item that turn, this Pokémon 
  picks up the item if it is not 
  already holding one. After each 
  battle, this Pokémon has a 10% 
  chance of picking up an item 
  if it is not already holding 
  one.

  The air balloon and eject button 
  cannot be picked up.

  The items that may be found 
  vary by game, and, since Pokémon 
  Emerald, by the Pokémon's level. 
  This ability is checked after 
  the battle ends, at which point 
  any temporary ability changes 
  have worn off.

  Frisk:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  it reveals an opposing Pokémon's 
  held item to all participating 
  trainers.

  In a double battle, if one 
  opponent has an item, this Pokémon 
  will Frisk that Pokémon; if both 
  have an item, it will Frisk one 
  at random.

  Insomnia:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to vital spirit in battle.
