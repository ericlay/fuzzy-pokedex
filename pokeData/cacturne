  Sand-veil:

    During a sandstorm, this Pokémon 
  has 1.25× its evasion, and it 
  does not take sandstorm damage 
  regardless of type.

  The evasion bonus does not 
  count as a stat modifier.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved in a sandstorm.

  Water-absorb:

    Whenever a water-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, it heals for 
  1/4 of its maximum HP, negating 
  any other effect on it.

  Water moves will ignore this 
  Pokémon's substitute.
