 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Iron-fist:

    Moves flagged as being punch-based 
  have 1.2× their base power for 
  this Pokémon.

  sucker punch is not flagged 
  as punch-based; its original, 
  Japanese name only means "surprise 
  attack".

  Mold-breaker:

    This Pokémon's moves completely 
  ignore abilities that could hinder 
  or prevent their effect on the 
  target.

  For example, this Pokémon's 
  moves ignore abilities that would 
  fully negate them, such as water 
  absorb; abilities that would 
  prevent any of their effects, 
  such as clear body, shell armor, 
  or sticky hold; and abilities 
  that grant any general protective 
  benefit, such as simple, snow 
  cloak, or thick fat. If an ability 
  could either hinder or help this 
  Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin 
  or unaware, the ability is ignored 
  either way.

  Abilities that do not fit this 
  description, even if they could 
  hinder moves in some other way, 
  are not affected. For example, 
  cursed body only affects potential 
  future uses of the move, while 
  liquid ooze and shadow tag can 
  only hinder a move's effect on 
  the user. This ablity cannot 
  ignore type or form changes granted 
  by abilities, for example color 
  change or forecast; nor effects 
  that were caused by abilities 
  but are no longer tied to an 
  ability, such as the rain from 
  drizzle. This ability cannot 
  ignore multitype at all.

  An ability ignored by this 
  ability is only nullified while 
  the move is being used. For example, 
  this Pokémon's moves can paralyze 
  a Pokémon with limber, but Limber 
  will activate and heal the paralysis 
  immediately thereafter, and this 
  Pokémon's spikes are not affected 
  by this ability after they have 
  been placed.

  When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  all participating trainers are 
  notified that it has this ability.

  This ability functions identically 
  to teravolt and turboblaze.

  Scrappy:

    This Pokémon ignores ghost-type 
  Pokémon's immunity to normal- 
  and fighting-type moves.

  Ghost Pokémon's other types 
  affect damage as usual.
