 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.

  Sand-stream:

    The weather changes to a sandstorm 
  when this Pokémon enters battle 
  and does not end unless cancelled 
  by another weather condition.

  If multiple Pokémon with this 
  ability, drizzle, drought, or 
  snow warning are sent out at 
  the same time, the abilities 
  will activate in order of Speed, 
  respecting trick room. Each ability's 
  weather will cancel the previous 
  weather, and only the weather 
  summoned by the slowest of the 
  Pokémon will stay.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved in a sandstorm.

  Sand-force:

    During a sandstorm, this Pokémon's 
  rock-, ground-, and steel-type 
  moves have 1.3× their base power. 
  This Pokémon does not take sandstorm 
  damage, regardless of type.
