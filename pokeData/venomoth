  Shield-dust:

    This Pokémon is immune to the 
  extra effects of moves used against 
  it.

  An extra effect is a move's 
  chance, listed as an "effect 
  chance", to inflict a status 
  ailment, cause a stat change, 
  or make the target flinch in 
  addition to the move's main effect. 
  For example, thunder shock's 
  paralysis is an extra effect, 
  but thunder wave's is not, nor 
  are knock off's item removal 
  and air cutter's increased critical 
  hit rate.

  Tinted-lens:

    This Pokémon deals twice as 
  much damage with moves that are 
  not very effective against the 
  target.

  Wonder-skin:

    Non-damaging moves have exactly 
  50% base accuracy against this 
  Pokémon.
