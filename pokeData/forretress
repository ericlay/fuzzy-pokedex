 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.

  Overcoat:

    This Pokémon does not take 
  damage from weather.
