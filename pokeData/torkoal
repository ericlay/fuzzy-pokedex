 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  White-smoke:

    This Pokémon cannot have its 
  stats lowered by other Pokémon.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any stat losses other than stat 
  modifiers, such as the Speed 
  cut from paralysis; nor self-inflicted 
  stat drops, such as the Special 
  Attack drop from overheat; nor 
  opponent-triggered stat boosts, 
  such as the Attack boost from 
  swagger. This Pokémon can still 
  be passed negative stat modifiers 
  through guard swap, heart swap, 
  or power swap.

  This ability functions identically 
  to clear body in battle.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved.

  Drought:

    The weather changes to strong 
  sunlight when this Pokémon enters 
  battle and does not end unless 
  cancelled by another weather 
  condition.

  If multiple Pokémon with this 
  ability, drizzle, sand stream, 
  or snow warning are sent out 
  at the same time, the abilities 
  will activate in order of Speed, 
  respecting trick room. Each ability's 
  weather will cancel the previous 
  weather, and only the weather 
  summoned by the slowest of the 
  Pokémon will stay.

  Shell-armor:

    Moves cannot score critical 
  hits against this Pokémon.

  This ability functions identically 
  to battle armor.
