  Liquid-ooze:

    Whenever a Pokémon would heal 
  after hitting this Pokémon with 
  a leeching move like absorb, 
  it instead loses as many HP as 
  it would usually gain.

  dream eater is unaffected.

  Sticky-hold:

    This Pokémon's hold item cannot 
  be removed by other Pokémon.

  Damaging moves that would remove 
  this Pokémon's item can still 
  inflict damage against this Pokémon, 
  e.g. knock off or pluck. This 
  Pokémon can still use moves that 
  involve the loss of its own item, 
  e.g. fling or trick.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the encounter 
  rate while fishing is increased.

  Gluttony:

    This Pokémon eats any held 
  Berry triggered by low HP when 
  it falls below 50% of its HP, 
  regardless of the Berry's usual 
  threshold.
