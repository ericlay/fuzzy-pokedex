 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.

  Weak-armor:

    Whenever a physical move hits 
  this Pokémon, its Speed rises 
  one stage and its Defense falls 
  one stage.

  This ability triggers on every 
  hit of a multiple-hit move.

  Sand-force:

    During a sandstorm, this Pokémon's 
  rock-, ground-, and steel-type 
  moves have 1.3× their base power. 
  This Pokémon does not take sandstorm 
  damage, regardless of type.
