  Natural-cure:

    This Pokémon is cured of any

  is switched out for another Pokémon.

  If this ability is acquired 
  during battle, the Pokémon is 
  cured upon leaving battle before 
  losing the temporary ability.

  Frisk:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  it reveals an opposing Pokémon's 
  held item to all participating 
  trainers.

  In a double battle, if one 
  opponent has an item, this Pokémon 
  will Frisk that Pokémon; if both 
  have an item, it will Frisk one 
  at random.

  item this Pokémon consumed was 
  a Berry and it is not currently 
  holding an item, it has a 50%

  or a 100% chance during strong 
  sunlight.
