  Linoone    Normal Type Pokémon

  Pickup:

    At the end of each turn, if 
  another Pokémon consumed or Flung 
  a held item that turn, this Pokémon 
  picks up the item if it is not 
  already holding one. After each 
  battle, this Pokémon has a 10% 
  chance of picking up an item 
  if it is not already holding 
  one.

  The air balloon and eject button 
  cannot be picked up.

  The items that may be found 
  vary by game, and, since Pokémon 
  Emerald, by the Pokémon's level. 
  This ability is checked after 
  the battle ends, at which point 
  any temporary ability changes 
  have worn off.

  Gluttony:

    This Pokémon eats any held 
  Berry triggered by low HP when 
  it falls below 50% of its HP, 
  regardless of the Berry's usual 
  threshold.

  Quick-feet:

    Whenever this Pokémon has a 
  major status ailment, it has 
  1.5× its Speed. This Pokémon 
  is not affected by the usual 
  Speed cut from paralysis.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved.
