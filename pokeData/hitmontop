 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Intimidate:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  the opponent's Attack is lowered 
  by one stage. In a double battle, 
  both opponents are affected.

  This ability also takes effect 
  when acquired during a battle, 
  but will not take effect again 
  if lost and reobtained without 
  leaving battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  on an opponent that has a substitute.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.

  Technician:

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× 
  their power if their base power 
  is 60 or less.

  This includes moves of variable 
  power, such as hidden power and 
  magnitude, when their power is 
  60 or less. helping hand's power 
  boost is taken into account for 
  any move, as is defense curl's 
  power boost for rollout.

  Steadfast:

    Whenever this Pokémon flinches, 
  its Speed rises one stage.
