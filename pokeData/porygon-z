  Adaptability:

    This Pokémon inflicts twice 
  as much damage with moves whose 
  types match its own, rather than 
  the usual same-type attack bonus 
  of 1.5×.

  Download:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  its Attack or Special Attack, 
  whichever corresponds to its 
  opponents' weaker total defensive 
  stat, rises one stage. In the 
  event of a tie, Special Attack 
  is raised.

  This ability also takes effect 
  when acquired during a battle.

  Analytic:

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.3× 
  their power when it moves last 
  in a turn.

  future sight and doom desire 
  are unaffected.
