 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Run-away:

    This Pokémon is always successful 
  fleeing from wild battles, even 
  if trapped by a move or ability.

  Flash-fire:

    This Pokémon is immune to fire-type 
  moves. Once this Pokémon has 
  been hit by a Fire move, its 
  own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× 
  as much damage until it leaves 
  battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  while the Pokémon is frozen. 
  The Fire damage bonus is retained 
  even if the Pokémon is frozen 
  and thawed or the ability is 
  lost or disabled. Fire moves 
  will ignore this Pokémon's substitute. 
  This ability takes effect even 
  on non-damaging moves, i.e. will 
  o wisp.

  Flame-body:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  burned.

  Overworld: If any Pokémon in 
  the party has this ability, each 
  egg in the party has its hatch 
  counter decreased by 2 (rather 
  than 1) each step cycle, making 
  eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly. 
  This effect does not stack if 
  multiple Pokémon have this ability 
  or magma armor.
