 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Shield-dust:

    This Pokémon is immune to the 
  extra effects of moves used against 
  it.

  An extra effect is a move's 
  chance, listed as an "effect 
  chance", to inflict a status 
  ailment, cause a stat change, 
  or make the target flinch in 
  addition to the move's main effect. 
  For example, thunder shock's 
  paralysis is an extra effect, 
  but thunder wave's is not, nor 
  are knock off's item removal 
  and air cutter's increased critical 
  hit rate.

  Compound-eyes:

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.3× 
  their accuracy.

  This ability has no effect 
  on the one-hit KO moves (fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold).

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  the chance of a wild Pokémon 
  holding a particular item is 
  raised from 50%, 5%, or 1% to 
  60%, 20%, or 5%, respectively.

  Friend-guard:

    All friendly Pokémon take 0.75× 
  as much direct damage from moves 
  while this Pokémon is in battle.

  This effect stacks if multiple 
  allied Pokémon have it.
