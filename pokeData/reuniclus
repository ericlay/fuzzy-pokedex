 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Overcoat:

    This Pokémon does not take 
  damage from weather.

  Magic-guard:

    This Pokémon is immune to damage 
  not directly caused by a move.

  For example, this Pokémon takes 
  no damage from from weather, 
  recoil, status ailments, or spikes, 
  but it still suffers from the 
  Attack cut when burned, and a 
  life orb will still power up 
  this Pokémon's moves without 
  damaging it. Anything that directly 
  depends on such damage will also 
  not happen; for example, leech 
  seed will neither hurt this Pokémon 
  nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon 
  with a jaboca berry or rowap 
  berry will not consume the berry 
  when hit by this Pokémon.

  The following are unaffected: 
  struggle, pain split (whether 
  used by or against this Pokémon), 
  belly drum, substitute, curse, 
  moves that knock the user out, 
  and damage from confusion.

  This Pokémon will neither lose 
  nor regain HP if it drains HP 
  from a Pokémon with liquid ooze.

  If this Pokémon is badly poisoned, 
  the poison counter is still increased 
  each turn; if the Pokémon loses 
  this ability, it will begin taking 
  as much damage as it would be 
  if it had been taking increasing 
  damage each turn.

  Regenerator:

    This Pokémon regains 1/3 of 
  its maximum HP when it is switched 
  out for another Pokémon under 
  any circumstances other than 
  having fainted.

  This ability does not take 
  effect when a battle ends.
