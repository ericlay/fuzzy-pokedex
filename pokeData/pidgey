 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Keen-eye:

    This Pokémon cannot have its 
  accuracy lowered.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any accuracy losses other than 
  stat modifiers, such as the accuracy 
  cut from fog; nor does it prevent 
  other Pokémon's evasion from 
  making this Pokémon's moves less 
  accurate. This Pokémon can still 
  be passed negative accuracy modifiers 
  through heart swap.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.

  Tangled-feet:

    When this Pokémon is confused, 
  it has twice its evasion.

  Big-pecks:

    This Pokémon's Defense cannot 
  be lowered by other Pokémon.

  This Pokémon can still be passed 
  negative Defense modifiers through 
  heart swap or guard swap.
