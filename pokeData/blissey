  Natural-cure:

    This Pokémon is cured of any

  is switched out for another Pokémon.

  If this ability is acquired 
  during battle, the Pokémon is 
  cured upon leaving battle before 
  losing the temporary ability.

  Serene-grace:

  their usual effect chance.

  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, flamethrower's chance 
  of burning the target is doubled, 
  but protect's chance of success 
  and air cutter's increased critical 
  hit rate are unaffected.

  secret power is unaffected.
