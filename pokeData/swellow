  Swellow    Normal Type Pokémon

  SWELLOW flies high above our 
  heads, making graceful arcs in 
  the sky.  Swellow dives 
  at a steep angle as soon as it 
  spots its prey.  The hapless 
  prey is tightly grasped by SWELLOW’s 
  clawed feet, preventing escape.

  Guts:

    Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, 
  burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, 
  it has 1.5× its Attack. This 
  Pokémon is not affected by the 
  usual Attack cut from a burn.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.

  Scrappy:

    This Pokémon ignores ghost-type 
  Pokémon's immunity to normal- 
  and fighting-type moves.

  Ghost Pokémon's other types 
  affect damage as usual.
