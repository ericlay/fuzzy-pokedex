  Iron-barbs:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user takes 1/8 of its maximum 
  HP in damage.

  This ability functions identically 
  to rough skin.

  Anticipation:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  if one of its opponents has a 
  move that is super effective 
  against it, self destruct, explosion, 
  or a one-hit knockout move, all 
  participating trainers are notified.

  The move itself is not revealed; 
  only that there is such a move. 
  Moves that inflict typeless damage, 
  such as future sight, and moves 
  of variable type, such as hidden 
  power, count as their listed 
  types. counter, metal burst, 
  mirror coat, and one-hit KO moves 
  to which this Pokémon is immune 
  do not trigger this ability.
