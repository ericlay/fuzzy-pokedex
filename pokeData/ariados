 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Swarm:

    When this Pokémon has 1/3 or 
  less of its HP remaining, its 
  bug-type moves inflict 1.5× as 
  much regular damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is increased.

  Insomnia:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to vital spirit in battle.

  Sniper:

    This Pokémon inflicts triple 
  damage with critical hits, rather 
  than the usual double damage.
