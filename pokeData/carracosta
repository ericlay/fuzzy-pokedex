  They can live both in the ocean

  in the bottom of a tanker.

 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Solid-rock:

    This Pokémon takes 0.75× as 
  much damage from moves that are 
  super effective against it.

  This ability functions identically 
  to filter.

  Sturdy:

    When this Pokémon is at full 
  HP, any hit that would knock 
  it out will instead leave it 
  with 1 HP. Regardless of its 
  current HP, it is also immune 
  to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, 
  guillotine, horn drill, and sheer 
  cold.

  If this Pokémon is holding 
  a focus sash, this ability takes 
  precedence and the item will 
  not be consumed.

  Swift-swim:

    This Pokémon's Speed is doubled 
  during rain.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.
