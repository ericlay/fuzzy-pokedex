  Taillow    Normal Type Pokémon

  TAILLOW courageously stands 
  its ground against foes, however 
  strong they may be.  This gutsy 
  Pokémon will remain defiant even 
  after a loss.  On the other hand, 
  it cries loudly if it becomes 
  hungry.

  Guts:

    Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, 
  burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, 
  it has 1.5× its Attack. This 
  Pokémon is not affected by the 
  usual Attack cut from a burn.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.

  Scrappy:

    This Pokémon ignores ghost-type 
  Pokémon's immunity to normal- 
  and fighting-type moves.

  Ghost Pokémon's other types 
  affect damage as usual.
