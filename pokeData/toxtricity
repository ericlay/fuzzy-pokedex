  Punk-rock:

  

  Plus:

    This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special 
  Attack if any friendly Pokémon 
  has plus or minus.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier. If either ability 
  is disabled by gastro acid, both 
  lose their effect.

  Technician:

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× 
  their power if their base power 
  is 60 or less.

  This includes moves of variable 
  power, such as hidden power and 
  magnitude, when their power is 
  60 or less. helping hand's power 
  boost is taken into account for 
  any move, as is defense curl's 
  power boost for rollout.
