  Reckless:

    This Pokémon's recoil moves 
  and crash moves have 1.2× their 
  base power.

  struggle is unaffected.

  The "crash moves" are the moves 
  that damage the user upon missing: 
  jump kick and high jump kick.

  Guts:

    Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, 
  burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, 
  it has 1.5× its Attack. This 
  Pokémon is not affected by the 
  usual Attack cut from a burn.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.

  Defiant:

    When any of this Pokémon's 
  stats are lowered, its Attack 
  rises by two stages.

  If multiple stats are lowered 
  at once, this ability takes effect 
  with each stat lowered.
