 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Run-away:

    This Pokémon is always successful 
  fleeing from wild battles, even 
  if trapped by a move or ability.

  Keen-eye:

    This Pokémon cannot have its 
  accuracy lowered.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any accuracy losses other than 
  stat modifiers, such as the accuracy 
  cut from fog; nor does it prevent 
  other Pokémon's evasion from 
  making this Pokémon's moves less 
  accurate. This Pokémon can still 
  be passed negative accuracy modifiers 
  through heart swap.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.

  Frisk:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  it reveals an opposing Pokémon's 
  held item to all participating 
  trainers.

  In a double battle, if one 
  opponent has an item, this Pokémon 
  will Frisk that Pokémon; if both 
  have an item, it will Frisk one 
  at random.
