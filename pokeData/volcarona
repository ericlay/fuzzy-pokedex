  Flame-body:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  burned.

  Overworld: If any Pokémon in 
  the party has this ability, each 
  egg in the party has its hatch 
  counter decreased by 2 (rather 
  than 1) each step cycle, making 
  eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly. 
  This effect does not stack if 
  multiple Pokémon have this ability 
  or magma armor.

  Swarm:

    When this Pokémon has 1/3 or 
  less of its HP remaining, its 
  bug-type moves inflict 1.5× as 
  much regular damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is increased.
