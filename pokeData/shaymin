  Multitype:

    If this Pokémon is holding 
  an elemental Plate, its type 
  and form change to match the 
  Plate.

  This Pokémon's held item, whether 
  or not it is a Plate, cannot 
  be taken by covet or thief, nor 
  removed by knock off, nor traded 
  by switcheroo or trick. Covet, 
  Thief, and Knock Off still inflict 
  damage against this Pokémon. 
  Unlike with sticky hold, this 
  Pokémon cannot use fling, Switcheroo, 
  or Trick to lose its item itself, 
  nor gain an item through Switcheroo 
  or Trick if it does not have 
  one.

  This ability has no effect 
  for any Pokémon other than arceus. 
  This ability cannot be traded 
  with skill swap, nor copied with 
  role play or trace, nor disabled 
  with gastro acid, nor changed 
  with worry seed. This Pokémon 
  cannot use Skill Swap or Role 
  Play to lose its ability itself. 
  mold breaker cannot ignore this 
  ability.

  If a Pokémon Transforms into 
  an Arceus with this ability, 
  it will Transform into Arceus's 
  default, normal-type form. If 
  the Transforming Pokémon is holding 
  a Plate, this ability will then 
  activate and change the Pokémon 
  into the corresponding form.
