 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Rivalry:

    This Pokémon inflicts 1.25× 
  as much regular damage against 
  Pokémon of the same gender and 
  0.75× as much regular damage 
  against Pokémon of the opposite 
  gender.

  If either Pokémon is genderless, 
  damage is unaffected.

  Intimidate:

    When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  the opponent's Attack is lowered 
  by one stage. In a double battle, 
  both opponents are affected.

  This ability also takes effect 
  when acquired during a battle, 
  but will not take effect again 
  if lost and reobtained without 
  leaving battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  on an opponent that has a substitute.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.

  Guts:

    Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, 
  burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, 
  it has 1.5× its Attack. This 
  Pokémon is not affected by the 
  usual Attack cut from a burn.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.
