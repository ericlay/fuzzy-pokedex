  Serene-grace:

    This Pokémon's moves have twice 
  their usual effect chance.

  An effect chance is a move's 
  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, flamethrower's chance 
  of burning the target is doubled, 
  but protect's chance of success 
  and air cutter's increased critical 
  hit rate are unaffected.

  secret power is unaffected.
