  Volt-absorb:

    Whenever an electric-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, it heals for 
  1/4 of its maximum HP, negating 
  any other effect on it.

  This ability will not take 
  effect if this Pokémon is ground-type 
  and thus immune to Electric moves. 
  Electric moves will ignore this 
  Pokémon's substitute.

  This effect includes non-damaging 
  moves, i.e. thunder wave.

  Hustle:

    This Pokémon's physical moves 
  do 1.5× as much regular damage, 
  but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.

  Special moves are unaffected. 
  Moves that do set damage, such 
  as seismic toss, have their accuracy 
  affected, but not their damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.
