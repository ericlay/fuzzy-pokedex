 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Ice-body:

    This Pokémon heals for 1/16 
  of its maximum HP after each 
  turn during hail, and it does 
  not take hail damage regardless 
  of type.

  Snow-warning:

    The weather changes to hail 
  when this Pokémon enters battle 
  and does not end unless cancelled 
  by another weather condition.

  If multiple Pokémon with this 
  ability, drizzle, drought, or 
  sand stream are sent out at the 
  same time, the abilities will 
  activate in order of Speed, respecting 
  trick room. Each ability's weather 
  will cancel the previous weather, 
  and only the weather summoned 
  by the slowest of the Pokémon 
  will stay.

  Weak-armor:

    Whenever a physical move hits 
  this Pokémon, its Speed rises 
  one stage and its Defense falls 
  one stage.

  This ability triggers on every 
  hit of a multiple-hit move.


 Location Areas:
