 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Pressure:

    Moves targetting this Pokémon 
  use one extra PP.

  This ability stacks if multiple 
  targets have it. This ability 
  still affects moves that fail 
  or miss. This ability does not 
  affect ally moves that target 
  either the entire field or just 
  its side, nor this Pokémon's 
  self-targetted moves; it does, 
  however, affect single-targetted 
  ally moves aimed at this Pokémon, 
  ally moves that target all other 
  Pokémon, and opponents' moves 
  that target the entire field. 
  If this ability raises a move's 
  PP cost above its remaining PP, 
  it will use all remaining PP.

  When this Pokémon enters battle, 
  all participating trainers are 
  notified that it has this ability.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.

  Inner-focus:

    This Pokémon cannot flinch.
