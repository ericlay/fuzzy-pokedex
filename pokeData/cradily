  Suction-cups:

    This Pokémon cannot be forced 
  out of battle by moves such as 
  whirlwind.

  dragon tail and circle throw 
  still inflict damage against 
  this Pokémon.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the success 
  rate while fishing is increased.

  Storm-drain:

    All other Pokémon's single-target 
  water-type moves are redirected 
  to this Pokémon, if it is an 
  eligible target. Other Pokémon's 
  Water moves raise this Pokémon's 
  Special Attack one stage, negating 
  any other effect on it, and cannot 
  miss it.

  If the move's intended target 
  also has this ability, the move 
  is not redirected. When multiple 
  Pokémon with this ability are 
  possible targets for redirection, 
  the move is redirected to the 
  one with the highest Speed stat, 
  or, in the case of a tie, to 
  a random tied Pokémon. follow 
  me takes precedence over this 
  ability.
