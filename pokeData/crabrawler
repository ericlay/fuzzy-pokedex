  Crabrawler    Fighting Type Pokémon

  While guarding its weak points 
  with its pincers, it looks for 
  an opening and unleashes punches. 
   When it loses, it foams at the 
  mouth and faints.

  Hyper-cutter:

    This Pokémon's Attack cannot 
  be lowered by other Pokémon.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any Attack losses other than 
  stat modifiers, such as the Attack 
  cut from a burn. This Pokémon 
  can still be passed negative 
  Attack modifiers through heart 
  swap or power swap.

  Iron-fist:

    Moves flagged as being punch-based 
  have 1.2× their base power for 
  this Pokémon.

  sucker punch is not flagged 
  as punch-based; its original, 
  Japanese name only means "surprise 
  attack".

  Anger-point:

    Whenever this Pokémon receives 
  a critical hit, its Attack rises 
  to the maximum of 6 stages.

  This ability will still take 
  effect if the critical hit is 
  received by a substitute.
