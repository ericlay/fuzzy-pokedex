  Breloom    Grass Type Pokémon

  fighting technique puts boxers 
  to shame.

  Effect-spore:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed, poisoned, or put to 
  sleep, chosen at random.

  Nothing is done to compensate 
  if the move's user is immune 
  to one of these ailments; there 
  is simply a lower chance that 
  the move's user will be affected.

  Poison-heal:

    If this Pokémon is poisoned, 
  it will heal for 1/8 of its maximum 
  HP after each turn rather than 
  taking damage. This includes 
  bad poison.

  Technician:

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× 
  their power if their base power 
  is 60 or less.

  This includes moves of variable 
  power, such as hidden power and 
  magnitude, when their power is 
  60 or less. helping hand's power 
  boost is taken into account for 
  any move, as is defense curl's 
  power boost for rollout.
