  Honey-gather:

    This Pokémon has a chance of 
  picking up honey after each battle. 
  This chance starts at 5% and 
  rises another 5% after every 
  tenth level: 5% from level 1–10, 
  10% from 11–20, and so on, up 
  to 50% from 91–100.

  This ability is checked after 
  the battle ends, at which point 
  any temporary ability changes 
  have worn off.

  Shield-dust:

    This Pokémon is immune to the 
  extra effects of moves used against 
  it.

  An extra effect is a move's 
  chance, listed as an "effect 
  chance", to inflict a status 
  ailment, cause a stat change, 
  or make the target flinch in 
  addition to the move's main effect. 
  For example, thunder shock's 
  paralysis is an extra effect, 
  but thunder wave's is not, nor 
  are knock off's item removal 
  and air cutter's increased critical 
  hit rate.

  Sweet-veil:

    Prevents friendly Pokémon from 
  sleeping.
