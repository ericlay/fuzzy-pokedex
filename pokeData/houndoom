  Early-bird:

    This Pokémon's remaining sleep 
  turn count falls by 2 rather 
  than 1.

  If this Pokémon's sleep counter 
  is at 1, it will fall to 0 and 
  then the Pokémon will wake up.

  Flash-fire:

    This Pokémon is immune to fire-type 
  moves. Once this Pokémon has 
  been hit by a Fire move, its 
  own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× 
  as much damage until it leaves 
  battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  while the Pokémon is frozen. 
  The Fire damage bonus is retained 
  even if the Pokémon is frozen 
  and thawed or the ability is 
  lost or disabled. Fire moves 
  will ignore this Pokémon's substitute. 
  This ability takes effect even 
  on non-damaging moves, i.e. will 
  o wisp.

    Opposing Pokémon cannot eat 
  held Berries while this Pokémon 
  is in battle.
