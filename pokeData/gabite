  Sand-veil:

    During a sandstorm, this Pokémon 
  has 1.25× its evasion, and it 
  does not take sandstorm damage 
  regardless of type.

  The evasion bonus does not 
  count as a stat modifier.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is halved in a sandstorm.

  Rough-skin:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user takes 1/8 of its maximum 
  HP in damage.

  This ability functions identically 
  to iron barbs.
