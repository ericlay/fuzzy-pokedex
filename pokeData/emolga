 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Static:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed.

  Pokémon that are immune to 
  electric-type moves can still 
  be paralyzed by this ability.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, there is a 
  50% chance that encounters will 
  be with an electric Pokémon, 
  if applicable.

  Motor-drive:

    Whenever an electric-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, its Speed 
  rises one stage, negating any 
  other effect on it.

  This ability will not take 
  effect if this Pokémon is immune 
  to Electric moves. Electric moves 
  will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.

  This effect includes non-damaging 
  moves, i.e. thunder wave.
