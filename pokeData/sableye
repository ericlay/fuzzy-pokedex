  Sableye    Dark Type Pokémon

  SABLEYE lead quiet lives deep 
  inside caverns.  They are feared, 
  however, because these Pokémon 
  are thought to steal the spirits 
  of people when their eyes burn 
  with a sinister glow in the darkness.

 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Keen-eye:

    This Pokémon cannot have its 
  accuracy lowered.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any accuracy losses other than 
  stat modifiers, such as the accuracy 
  cut from fog; nor does it prevent 
  other Pokémon's evasion from 
  making this Pokémon's moves less 
  accurate. This Pokémon can still 
  be passed negative accuracy modifiers 
  through heart swap.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any random encounter with a Pokémon 
  five or more levels lower than 
  it has a 50% chance of being 
  skipped.

  Stall:

    This Pokémon moves last within 
  its priority bracket.

  Multiple Pokémon with this 
  ability move in order of Speed 
  amongst themselves.

  The full incense and lagging 
  tail take precedence over this 
  ability; that is, Pokémon with 
  these items move after Pokémon 
  with this ability. Pokémon with 
  both this ability and one of 
  these items are delayed as much 
  as if they had only the item.

  This ability works as usual 
  during trick room: Pokémon with 
  this ability will move in reverse 
  order of Speed after Pokémon 
  without it.

  Prankster:

    This Pokémon's non-damaging 
  moves have their priority increased 
  by one stage.
