  Unaware:

    This Pokémon ignores other 
  Pokémon's stat modifiers for 
  the purposes of damage and accuracy 
  calculation.

  Effectively, this affects modifiers 
  of every stat except Speed.

  The power of punishment and 
  stored power is calculated as 
  usual. When this Pokémon hurts 
  itself in confusion, its stat 
  modifiers affect damage as usual.
