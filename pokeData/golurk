 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Iron-fist:

    Moves flagged as being punch-based 
  have 1.2× their base power for 
  this Pokémon.

  sucker punch is not flagged 
  as punch-based; its original, 
  Japanese name only means "surprise 
  attack".

  Klutz:

    In battle, this Pokémon cannot 
  use its held item, nor will the 
  item have any passive effect 
  on the battle, positive or negative. 
  This Pokémon also cannot use 
  fling.

  The Speed cut from the iron 
  ball and the effort items (the 
  macho brace, power weight, power 
  bracer, power belt, power lens, 
  power band, and power anklet) 
  is unaffected. Items that do 
  not directly affect the battle, 
  such as the exp share, the amulet 
  coin, or the soothe bell, work 
  as usual. All held items work 
  as usual out of battle.

  Other moves that use the held 
  item, such as natural gift and 
  switcheroo, work as usual.

  No-guard:

    Moves used by or against this 
  Pokémon never miss.

  One-hit KO moves are unaffected. 
  Moves affected by this ability 
  can hit Pokémon during the preparation 
  turn of moves like dig or fly.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is doubled.
