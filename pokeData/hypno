  Insomnia:

    This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

  This causes rest to fail altogether. 
  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires 
  this ability, it will immediately 
  wake up; this includes when regaining 
  a lost ability upon leaving battle.

  This ability functions identically 
  to vital spirit in battle.

  Forewarn:

  

  Inner-focus:

    This Pokémon cannot flinch.
