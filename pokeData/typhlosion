  Blaze:

    When this Pokémon has 1/3 or 
  less of its HP remaining, its 
  fire-type moves inflict 1.5× 
  as much regular damage.

  Flash-fire:

    This Pokémon is immune to fire-type 
  moves. Once this Pokémon has 
  been hit by a Fire move, its 
  own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× 
  as much damage until it leaves 
  battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  while the Pokémon is frozen. 
  The Fire damage bonus is retained 
  even if the Pokémon is frozen 
  and thawed or the ability is 
  lost or disabled. Fire moves 
  will ignore this Pokémon's substitute. 
  This ability takes effect even 
  on non-damaging moves, i.e. will
