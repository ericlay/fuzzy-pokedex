  Static:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed.

  Pokémon that are immune to 
  electric-type moves can still 
  be paralyzed by this ability.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, there is a 
  50% chance that encounters will 
  be with an electric Pokémon, 
  if applicable.

  Plus:

    This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special 
  Attack if any friendly Pokémon 
  has plus or minus.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier. If either ability 
  is disabled by gastro acid, both 
  lose their effect.
