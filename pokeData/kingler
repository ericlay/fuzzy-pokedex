 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Hyper-cutter:

    This Pokémon's Attack cannot 
  be lowered by other Pokémon.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any Attack losses other than 
  stat modifiers, such as the Attack 
  cut from a burn. This Pokémon 
  can still be passed negative 
  Attack modifiers through heart 
  swap or power swap.

  Shell-armor:

    Moves cannot score critical 
  hits against this Pokémon.

  This ability functions identically 
  to battle armor.

  Sheer-force:

    This Pokémon's moves with extra 
  effects have 1.3× their power, 
  but lose their extra effects.

  An effect chance is a move's 
  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, thunder shock's paralysis 
  is an extra effect, but thunder 
  wave's is not, nor are knock 
  off's item removal and air cutter's 
  increased critical hit rate.

  Moves that lower the user's 
  stats are unaffected.
