  Ripen:

  

  Gluttony:

    This Pokémon eats any held 
  Berry triggered by low HP when 
  it falls below 50% of its HP, 
  regardless of the Berry's usual 
  threshold.

  Hustle:

    This Pokémon's physical moves 
  do 1.5× as much regular damage, 
  but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.

  Special moves are unaffected. 
  Moves that do set damage, such 
  as seismic toss, have their accuracy 
  affected, but not their damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, higher-levelled 
  Pokémon have their encounter 
  rate increased.
