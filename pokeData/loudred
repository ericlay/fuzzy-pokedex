  Soundproof:

    This Pokémon is immune to moves 
  flagged as being sound-based.

  heal bell is unaffected. uproar 
  still prevents this Pokémon from 
  sleeping. This Pokémon can still 
  receive a Perish Song counter 
  through baton pass, and will 
  retain a Perish Song counter 
  if it acquires this ability after 
  Perish Song is used.

  howl, roar of time, sonic boom, 
  and yawn are not flagged as sound-based.

  Scrappy:

    This Pokémon ignores ghost-type 
  Pokémon's immunity to normal- 
  and fighting-type moves.

  Ghost Pokémon's other types 
  affect damage as usual.
