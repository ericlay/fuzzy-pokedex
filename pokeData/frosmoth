  Shield-dust:

    This Pokémon is immune to the 
  extra effects of moves used against 
  it.

  An extra effect is a move's 
  chance, listed as an "effect 
  chance", to inflict a status 
  ailment, cause a stat change, 
  or make the target flinch in 
  addition to the move's main effect. 
  For example, thunder shock's 
  paralysis is an extra effect, 
  but thunder wave's is not, nor 
  are knock off's item removal 
  and air cutter's increased critical 
  hit rate.
