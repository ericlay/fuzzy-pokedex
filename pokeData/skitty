  Cute-charm:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  infatuated.

  Overworld: If the first Pokémon 
  in the party has this ability, 
  any wild Pokémon whose species 
  can be either gender has a 2/3 
  chance of being set to the opposite 
  gender, and a 1/3 chance of having 
  a random gender as usual.

  Normalize:

    This Pokémon's moves all act 
  as if they were normal-type.

  Moves that inflict typeless 
  damage do so as usual. Moves 
  of variable type, such as hidden 
  power, are affected. They otherwise 
  work as usual, however; weather 
  ball, for example, is always 
  forced to be Normal, but it still 
  has doubled power and looks different 
  during weather.

  As thunder wave is prevented 
  by immunities, unlike most non-damaging 
  moves, it does not affect ghost-type 
  Pokémon under the effect of this 
  ability.

  Wonder-skin:

    Non-damaging moves have exactly 
  50% base accuracy against this 
  Pokémon.
