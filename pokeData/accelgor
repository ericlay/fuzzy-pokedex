  Hydration:

    This Pokémon is cured of any 
  major status ailment after each 
  turn during rain.

  Sticky-hold:

    This Pokémon's hold item cannot 
  be removed by other Pokémon.

  Damaging moves that would remove 
  this Pokémon's item can still 
  inflict damage against this Pokémon, 
  e.g. knock off or pluck. This 
  Pokémon can still use moves that 
  involve the loss of its own item, 
  e.g. fling or trick.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the encounter 
  rate while fishing is increased.

  Unburden:

    When this Pokémon uses or loses 
  its held item, its Speed is doubled. 
  If it gains another item or leaves 
  battle, this bonus is lost.

  This includes when the Pokémon 
  drops its item because of knock 
  off. This bonus does not count 
  as a stat modifier. There is 
  no notification when this ability 
  takes effect.
