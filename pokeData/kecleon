  Color-change:

    Whenever this Pokémon takes 
  damage from a move, the Pokémon's 
  type changes to match the move.

  If the Pokémon has two types, 
  both are overridden. The Pokémon 
  must directly take damage; for 
  example, moves blocked by a substitute 
  will not trigger this ability, 
  nor will moves that deal damage 
  indirectly, such as spikes.

  This ability takes effect on 
  only the last hit of a multiple-hit 
  attack.

  In Pokémon Colosseum and XD: 
  Gale of Darkness, this ability 
  does not take effect on Shadow-type 
  moves.

  Protean:

    Changes the bearer's type to 
  match each move it uses.

  The type change takes place 
  just before the move is used.
