  Flash-fire:

    This Pokémon is immune to fire-type 
  moves. Once this Pokémon has 
  been hit by a Fire move, its 
  own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× 
  as much damage until it leaves 
  battle.

  This ability has no effect 
  while the Pokémon is frozen. 
  The Fire damage bonus is retained 
  even if the Pokémon is frozen 
  and thawed or the ability is 
  lost or disabled. Fire moves 
  will ignore this Pokémon's substitute. 
  This ability takes effect even 
  on non-damaging moves, i.e. will 
  o wisp.

  Drought:

    The weather changes to strong 
  sunlight when this Pokémon enters 
  battle and does not end unless 
  cancelled by another weather 
  condition.

  If multiple Pokémon with this 
  ability, drizzle, sand stream, 
  or snow warning are sent out 
  at the same time, the abilities 
  will activate in order of Speed, 
  respecting trick room. Each ability's 
  weather will cancel the previous 
  weather, and only the weather 
  summoned by the slowest of the 
  Pokémon will stay.
