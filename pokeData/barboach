  move that is super effective 
  against it, self destruct, explosion, 
  or a one-hit knockout move, all 
  participating trainers are notified.

  The move itself is not revealed; 
  only that there is such a move.

  such as future sight, and moves 
  of variable type, such as hidden 
  power, count as their listed 
  types. counter, metal burst, 
  mirror coat, and one-hit KO moves 
  to which this Pokémon is immune 
  do not trigger this ability.
