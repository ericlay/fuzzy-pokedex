  Rock-head:

    This Pokémon does not receive 
  recoil damage from its recoil 
  moves.

  struggle's recoil is unaffected. 
  This ability does not prevent 
  crash damage from missing with 
  jump kick or high jump kick.

  Sheer-force:

    This Pokémon's moves with extra 
  effects have 1.3× their power, 
  but lose their extra effects.

  An effect chance is a move's 
  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, thunder shock's paralysis 
  is an extra effect, but thunder 
  wave's is not, nor are knock 
  off's item removal and air cutter's 
  increased critical hit rate.

  Moves that lower the user's 
  stats are unaffected.
