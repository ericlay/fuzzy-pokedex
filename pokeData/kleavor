 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Swarm:

    When this Pokémon has 1/3 or 
  less of its HP remaining, its 
  bug-type moves inflict 1.5× as 
  much regular damage.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, the wild encounter 
  rate is increased.

  Sheer-force:

    This Pokémon's moves with extra 
  effects have 1.3× their power, 
  but lose their extra effects.

  An effect chance is a move's 
  chance to inflict a status ailment, 
  cause a stat change, or make 
  the target flinch in addition 
  to the move's main effect. For 
  example, thunder shock's paralysis 
  is an extra effect, but thunder 
  wave's is not, nor are knock 
  off's item removal and air cutter's 
  increased critical hit rate.

  Moves that lower the user's 
  stats are unaffected.

  Steadfast:

    Whenever this Pokémon flinches, 
  its Speed rises one stage.
