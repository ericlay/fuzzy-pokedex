  Flower-gift:

    Friendly Pokémon have 1.5× 
  their Attack and Special Defense 
  during strong sunlight if any 
  friendly Pokémon has this ability.

  Unlike forecast, multitype, 
  and zen mode, this ability is 
  not tied to its Pokémon's form 
  change; cherrim will switch between 
  its forms even if it loses this 
  ability. As such, this ability 
  also works if obtained by a Pokémon 
  other than Cherrim.
