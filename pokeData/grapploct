  Limber:

    This Pokémon cannot be paralyzed.

  If a Pokémon is paralyzed and 
  acquires this ability, its paralysis 
  is healed; this includes when 
  regaining a lost ability upon 
  leaving battle.

  Technician:

    This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× 
  their power if their base power 
  is 60 or less.

  This includes moves of variable 
  power, such as hidden power and 
  magnitude, when their power is 
  60 or less. helping hand's power 
  boost is taken into account for 
  any move, as is defense curl's 
  power boost for rollout.
