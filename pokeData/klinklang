  Plus:

    This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special 
  Attack if any friendly Pokémon

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier. If either ability 
  is disabled by gastro acid, both 
  lose their effect.

  Clear-body:

    This Pokémon cannot have its 
  stats lowered by other Pokémon.

  This ability does not prevent 
  any stat losses other than stat 
  modifiers, such as the Speed 
  cut from paralysis. This Pokémon 
  can still be passed negative 
  stat modifiers through guard 
  swap, heart swap, or power swap.

  This ability functions identically 
  to white smoke in battle.
