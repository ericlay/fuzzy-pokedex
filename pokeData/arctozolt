 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Volt-absorb:

    Whenever an electric-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, it heals for 
  1/4 of its maximum HP, negating 
  any other effect on it.

  This ability will not take 
  effect if this Pokémon is ground-type 
  and thus immune to Electric moves. 
  Electric moves will ignore this 
  Pokémon's substitute.

  This effect includes non-damaging 
  moves, i.e. thunder wave.

  Static:

    Whenever a move makes contact 
  with this Pokémon, the move's 
  user has a 30% chance of being 
  paralyzed.

  Pokémon that are immune to 
  electric-type moves can still 
  be paralyzed by this ability.

  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon 
  has this ability, there is a 
  50% chance that encounters will 
  be with an electric Pokémon, 
  if applicable.

  Slush-rush:

    During Hail, this Pokémon has 
  double Speed.
