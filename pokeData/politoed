 ↞---------------|ABILITIES|---------------↠

  Water-absorb:

    Whenever a water-type move 
  hits this Pokémon, it heals for 
  1/4 of its maximum HP, negating 
  any other effect on it.

  Water moves will ignore this 
  Pokémon's substitute.

  Damp:

    While this Pokémon is in battle, 
  self destruct and explosion will 
  fail and aftermath will not take 
  effect.

  Drizzle:

    The weather changes to rain 
  when this Pokémon enters battle 
  and does not end unless replaced 
  by another weather condition.

  If multiple Pokémon with this 
  ability, drought, sand stream, 
  or snow warning are sent out 
  at the same time, the abilities 
  will activate in order of Speed, 
  respecting trick room. Each ability's 
  weather will cancel the previous 
  weather, and only the weather 
  summoned by the slowest of the 
  Pokémon will stay.
