  Slow-start:

    This Pokémon's Attack and Speed 
  are halved for five turns upon 
  entering battle.

  This ability also takes effect 
  when acquired during battle. 
  If this Pokémon loses its ability 
  before the five turns are up, 
  its Attack and Speed return to 
  normal; if it then regains this 
  ability without leaving battle, 
  its Attack and Speed are halved 
  again, but the counter keeps 
  counting from where it was.
