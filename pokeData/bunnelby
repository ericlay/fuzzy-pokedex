  Pickup:

    At the end of each turn, if 
  another Pokémon consumed or Flung 
  a held item that turn, this Pokémon 
  picks up the item if it is not 
  already holding one. After each 
  battle, this Pokémon has a 10% 
  chance of picking up an item 
  if it is not already holding 
  one.

  The air balloon and eject button 
  cannot be picked up.

  The items that may be found 
  vary by game, and, since Pokémon 
  Emerald, by the Pokémon's level. 
  This ability is checked after 
  the battle ends, at which point 
  any temporary ability changes 
  have worn off.

  Cheek-pouch:

    Restores HP upon eating a Berry, 
  in addition to the Berry's effect.

  Huge-power:

    This Pokémon's Attack is doubled 
  while in battle.

  This bonus does not count as 
  a stat modifier.

  This ability functions identically 
  to pure power.
