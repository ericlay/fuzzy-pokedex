  Shedinja    Bug Type Pokémon

  SHEDINJA’s hard body doesn’t 
  move - not even a twitch.  In 
  fact, its body appears to be 
  merely a hollow shell.  It is 
  believed that Shedinja will 
  steal the spirit of anyone peering 
  into its hollow body from its 
  back.

  Wonder-guard:

    This Pokémon is immune to damaging 
  moves that are not super effective 
  against it.

  Moves that inflict fixed damage, 
  such as night shade or seismic 
  toss, are considered super effective 
  if their types are. Damage not 
  directly dealt by moves, such 
  as damage from weather, a status 
  ailment, or spikes, is not prevented.

  This ability cannot be copied 
  with role play or traded away 
  with skill swap, but it can be 
  copied with trace, disabled with 
  gastro acid, or changed with 
  worry seed. This Pokémon can 
  still use Role Play itself to 
  lose this ability, but not Skill 
  Swap.

  If this Pokémon has a substitute, 
  this ability will block moves 
  as usual and any moves not blocked 
  will react to the Substitute 
  as usual.
