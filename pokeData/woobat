  Unaware:

    This Pokémon ignores other 
  Pokémon's stat modifiers for 
  the purposes of damage and accuracy 
  calculation.

  Effectively, this affects modifiers 
  of every stat except Speed.

  The power of punishment and 
  stored power is calculated as 
  usual. When this Pokémon hurts 
  itself in confusion, its stat 
  modifiers affect damage as usual.

  Klutz:

    In battle, this Pokémon cannot 
  use its held item, nor will the 
  item have any passive effect 
  on the battle, positive or negative. 
  This Pokémon also cannot use 
  fling.

  The Speed cut from the iron 
  ball and the effort items (the 
  macho brace, power weight, power 
  bracer, power belt, power lens, 
  power band, and power anklet) 
  is unaffected. Items that do 
  not directly affect the battle, 
  such as the exp share, the amulet 
  coin, or the soothe bell, work 
  as usual. All held items work 
  as usual out of battle.

  Other moves that use the held 
  item, such as natural gift and 
  switcheroo, work as usual.

  Simple:

    Each stage of this Pokémon's 
  stat modifiers acts as two stages. 
  These doubled stages are still 
  limited to a minimum of -6 and 
  a maximum of 6.

  This Pokémon can still accumulate 
  less than -3 or more than 3 stages 
  of stat modifiers, even though 
  the extra ones have no effect 
  after doubling.
