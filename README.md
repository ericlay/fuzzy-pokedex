Very simple fzf based pokedex I built for my son to enjoy

Requires BeautifulSoup4, fzf, parallel, pokemon-colorscipts and, any nerd font; all else should be there

Credits to the great projects below in which do most the heavy lifting: \

## To-do

* [ ] Make sure it works for every single pokemon
* [ ] Get higher quality images to output if possible
* [ ] Scrape more relevant information about the pokemon
* [ ] Rewrite scraping method to use [Bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net)
